            <h2>The David Chow Foundation Center</h2>
            <p>
                David’s home in Los Angeles was a reflection
                of the man who lived there. Recessed from the world
                outside, the first thing any visitor noticed was the state-of-the-art
                security system. The security system,
                workroom, kung-fu practice area and photo studio was in direct
                contrast to the easygoing luxury of the jacuzzi, suntan room, sauna,
                and game room complete with slot and pinball machines. “All I need is
                a roof over my head,” said David, “but I want my friends to enjoy
                themselves when they come over.” A comment expected from the man who
                diligently began each day thinking of three things he would do to
                better the lives of others. And the lives that were been brightened by
                David are legion…

                Today the David Chow Foundation Center has become a focal point and
                headquarters of the David Chow Humanitarian Award Foundation. It now
                serves the needs of the Foundation and yet still reflects David Chow’s
                style. Through care and judicious management, this spectacular estate
                will enable the Trustees to continue David’s legacy and philosophy.
                Consequently, the David Chow Foundation Center will be made available
                for a variety of uses, such as private events, motion picture and
                still photography location rental, short-term leases and corporate
                functions. Details can be viewed via the David Chow Foundation Center
                menu on this site.
