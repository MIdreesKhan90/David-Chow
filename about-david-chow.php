                <h2>A Boy’s Journey to a Strange Land</h2>
                <p>
                    Young Chow Tai-Wai’s life was changed forever at the age of ten, near his home in Shanghai, China, when
                    he was
                    set upon and beaten up by a group of bullies. It was then that he vowed never to be a victim again and
                    also to
                    do all within his power to prevent others from being victims. He plunged then into bodybuilding, a
                    pursuit which
                    would later earn him the title of “Mr. Hong Kong”. Knowing that sheer strength was no match for skill,
                    he also
                    dedicated himself to a lifetime study of martial arts. In years to come, these skills would earn him
                    worldwide
                    recognition as a judo champion and as technical director of the Emmy award-winning television series
                    Kung-Fu.

                <p>Still in his teens, he left Hong Kong. His father handed him US$2,400 for his college education, and some
                    valuable advice which would serve as his inspiration and guideline for the rest of his life: “measure
                    the depth
                    rather than the length of one’s life… “Already a visionary, Chow Tai-Wai wanted to come to America. In a
                    few
                    months, through careful investments, the teenager who had a precocious knowledge of economic principles
                    increased his funds by over 700%… His goal of an American education was now in his grasp… His
                    overwhelming
                    adventure was about to begin…..
                </p>
                <p>When asked about the
                    frightening experience of arriving alone on American shores, David explains “There are two types of
                    plants,
                    indoor plants and outdoor plants… If you are an indoor plant, you are nurtured and care for, but your
                    roots
                    don’t grow. If you are an outdoor plant, you experience and survive blizzards, winds and chilling colds,
                    but
                    your roots grow deep and strong, and in turn, you are able to benefit others. You provide fruits to the
                    needy,
                    shelter for small animals… children can play in your branches, and the elderly can rest in your shade. I
                    was
                    resolved to become a tree… “At his arrival in Los Angeles, instead of simply enrolling in high school,
                    David
                    took the college board exams with 320 adult applicants, and was one of the nine who passed! This earned
                    him
                    admission to UCLA. After graduating, he went on to earn his master’s degree in economics from USC.
